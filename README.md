# welcome to the fediverse

## Choose an instance

First is choosing an instance. This is like choosing an email provider. You can use a bunch and then follow folks on other fedi places mostly seamlessly.

If you’re reading this and know the admin, you may be eligible for [https://gunbark.dev/](https://gunbark.dev/). 

If not, [https://mastodon.social/](https://mastodon.social/explore) and [https://pixelfed.social](https://pixelfed.social) are large, well-supported instances.

## Making an account

You’re going to choose a username. Your username in the fediverse is \<yourusername\>@\<yourinstance\>. So username ‘john’ on the gunbark.dev instance would be @john@gunbark.dev. There can be @john@mastodon.social, and @john@pixelfed.social. It’s fine.

instances are, unfortunately, self-hosted and can be somewhat ephemeral (eg the owner decides to fuck off). This is normal. Decent instance owners will give sufficient notice of at least 90 days, and the fediverse supports moving your account name and followers between instances. It *also* increasingly supports moving all of your posts and media between instances, but more on that later.

Pick either a well-known public instance or one where you explicitly trust your admin(s).

## You’ve got an account

Remember to turn on 2fa if you can. Social media is still social media. You can search for new people to follow using their full account names (like emails\!). A great early person to search for, and follow, is **@FediTips@social.growyourown.services** They regularly post good ideas and folks to follow.

This can be confusing to some, but if you visit pixelfed.social and try to login with your mastodon.social creds it won’t work. If you want to follow someone on pixelfed.social, login on the instance your account is at, and then search for the folks on pixelfed.social you want to follow.

**Please add a user icon, a description of something you think is relevant in your bio, and ideally an introduction post (tagged with \#introduction). Many folks (including yours truly) do not trust brand-new accounts without context and suspect them of being bots.**

## Finding folks to follow

There’s no popularity contest algorithms here, so finding follows is old school: by hand. A great, searchable directory is maintained at [https://fedi.directory/](https://fedi.directory/). 

Follow people they boost\! Follow hashtags (below). Follow often and unfollow often.

## Hashtags

The fediverse doesn’t (normally) support full text search. Some fedi software allows users to turn it on, but because this is a self-hosted endeavor, search indexing is expensive and so mostly folks follow hashtags. A hashtag is something with a \# in front of it. Camel case is good manners so screen readers can do their best, eg \#CamelCase rather than \#camelcase. Use hashtags if you want your posts to be seen by more than your immediate followers. You can click on a hashtag you see and then follow the hashtag itself (and see posts with it in your feed).

## Pictures And Media

Good opsec, always. Remember to not show pictures or video of where you are unless that’s a conscious decision. 

Popular instance software does strip exiv data from photos. **Not all instance software can strip exiv data from videos; most make a best-effort attempt.** 

Please add descriptive text for accessibility purposes, not everyone has fully working eyes.

## Privacy

Social media is public is social media is public. Followers-only posts are not secure to a strong standard. DMs are also not secure to a strong standard; admins of the involved instances can still read them. If @[john@mastodon.social](mailto:john@mastodon.social) sends a DM to @[roger@pixelfed.social](mailto:roger@pixelfed.social) then the admins of both mastodon.social and pixelfed.social can read everything.

**If you must talk about private things online, use [Signal](https://signal.org/), not social media of any form.**
